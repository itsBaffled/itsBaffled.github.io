Hey, I'm Jack also known as itsBaffled, I am a self taught aussie game dev with a huge passion for learning new stuff. I love what programming allows me to do and the problem solving opportunities that come with every day game development. 
<br>

The blog is intended to be a collection of my personal notes with c++ and unreal engine, by sharing them I hope to help others but also give back to the community who has also posted their own blogs and notes which have helped me. 
<br>


If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/itsBaffled) or at the [Unreal Source Discord](https://discord.com/invite/unrealsource) which is where I am most active.
